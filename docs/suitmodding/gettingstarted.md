# Getting started

In this category you will find a series of guides related to altering, and even adding new, suits for Hitman: World of Assassination. These guides are presented in order of beginner to expert, starting with simple retexturing jobs, escalating to swapping different parts, to editing parts in Blender and introducing them to Glacier 2 as entirely new models, and finishing off with how to make a suit addon mod for [The Peacock Project](https://thepeacockproject.org/), meaning your custom suit will be *added* to the game, and not replace any existing suits.

We recommend that you start at the beginning and work your way up, as the early guides have tips for best practices and good habits to form, and the later guides will assume that you have a good grasp of the basics of the former guides.
