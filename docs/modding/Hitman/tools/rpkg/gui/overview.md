# Overview

The RPKG tool has two panels.

## Left panel

The left panel includes the tabs Resource View, the Dependency View and the Search

-   The Resource View shows an overview of the currently loaded RPKG(s) and its content in a file tree structure. The content of RPKG's are sorted into categories according to [File Formats](../../glacier2/fileformats.md).
-   The Dependency View shows an overview of the currently loaded RPKG(s) and its content. Files can be expanded upon to show the dependencies.
-   The Search includes a search field which can be used to search a file containing the string in the filename. The content of RPKG's are sorted into categories according to [File Formats](../../glacier2/fileformats.md).
