# Getting started

In this category you will find a series of guides related to creating a new campaign for Hitman: World of Assassination. These guides will provide all the information needed to create a new campaign that can be played in Hitman: WoA in Offline mode. Each step is necessary to create a functioning campaign.

# Requirements

This is a list of tools that are essential for any kind of Hitman modding. The tutorials will assume you have them installed and will ask you to make frequent use of them.

-   [RPKG Tool](../../../rpkg)
-   [Simple Mod Framework](https://github.com/atampy25/simple-mod-framework/releases/latest)
-   [QuickEntity Editor](https://github.com/atampy25/quickentity-editor-next/releases/latest)
    -   When you first start QuickEntity Editor you will need to set up the paths to your game installation. Start QNE, go to Settings and set your **Retail** and **Runtime** paths accordingly, or you will not be able to load entities directly from the game.
-   A program to read and edit JSON files ([VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) or [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) is recommended, but any basic code editor will suffice)
-   A program to extract and archive ZIP files (such as [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/))
