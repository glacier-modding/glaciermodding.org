# Getting started

In this category you will find a series of guides related to creating a new campaign for Hitman: World of Assassination. These guides will provide all the information needed to create a new campaign that can be played in Hitman: WoA in Offline mode, as well as on the Peacock server in Online mode.

# Requirements

This is a list of tools that are essential for any kind of Hitman modding. The tutorials will assume you have them installed and will ask you to make frequent use of them. We will also be installing a few more tools along the way.

-   [Simple Mod Framework](https://github.com/atampy25/simple-mod-framework/releases/latest)
-   [QuickEntity Editor](https://github.com/atampy25/quickentity-editor-next/releases/latest)
    -   When you first start QuickEntity Editor you will need to set up the paths to your game installation. Start QNE, go to Settings and set your **Retail** and **Runtime** paths accordingly, or you will not be able to load entities directly from the game.
-   A program to read and edit JSON files [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) or ([VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) is recommended, but any basic code editor will suffice). This tutorial will assume you are using WebStorm.
-   A program to extract and archive ZIP files (such as [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/))
