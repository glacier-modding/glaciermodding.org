# Extracting files
The extract file feature allows you to extract individual files and their depenencies. Use the Resource View or the Search to locate a correct file. Once located right-clicking the file will give you the option to export the file. If the file has depenencies these can be extracted by using the `Extract Hash Depends` on the right panel.

Before extracting you should ask yourself if you are editing the correct files. For example if you want to remove an accessory from an outfit you should be editing TEMP and TBLU files (which contain the references to the combination of outfit and accessories) and not the PRIM files (which contains the mesh).
